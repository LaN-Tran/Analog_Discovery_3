# Folder description

- 1. `Analog_Transistor.py`

  - An exact copy of the Digilent example (whose name is the same) with some comments to better understand some codes/ commands.

- 2. `analog_diode.ipynb`

  - Seperate codes corresponding to each actions which are used to control and receive information with the Analog Discovery 3 device.

  - Include experiments:

   - EXP 1: simple setup to understand how to read out configuration information of instruments in the device (for verifying the configuration step, also provide understanding of the instrument operating states (e.g Configure, Ready, Arm, Done))
   
   - EXP 2: planning for experiment 2 for paralleling each action of interacting with the Analog Discovery 3 device.
